{"Name":"Coronaviruses","Description":"Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that cause diseases in animals and humans. They often circulate among camels, cats, and bats, and can sometimes evolve and infect people.In animals, coronaviruses can cause diarrhea in cows and pigs, and upper respiratory disease in chickens. In humans, the viruses can cause mild respiratory infections, like the common cold, but can lead to serious illnesses, like pneumonia.Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. They are closely monitored by public health officials. // Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)// The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 first emerged in a seafood and poultry market in the Chinese city of Wuhan in 2019. One year later, the US launched a national vaccination campaign. There are steps you can take to help stop the spread: Stay home as advised, wear a mask, practice social distancing, wash your hands frequently, and get vaccinated when eligible.// Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)//Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and spread to more than 25 other countries. MERS originated in camels and emerged to infect people. Symptoms usually include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and often progress to pneumonia. About 3 or 4 out of every 10 patients reported with MERS have died. MERS cases continue to occur, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula; however, as of 2019, there have been only two confirmed cases of MERS in the US, both in 2014.//Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)//Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) originated in small mammal and emerged to infect people. SARS was first reported in Southern China in 2002 and the illness spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Symptoms include fever, chills, and body aches, and may progress to pneumonia. Infection with the SARS virus causes acute respiratory distress (severe breathing difficulty), with a mortality rate of about 10 percent. No human cases of SARS have been reported anywhere in the world since 2004.//Symptoms//Most people get infected with human strains of coronaviruses at some point in their lives. These illnesses usually last for a short amount of time, and symptoms may include: fever/ cough/headache/runny nose/sore throat/Additional symptoms have been reported with COVID-19. Human coronaviruses can cause other more serious illnesses, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. This is more common in individuals with heart and lung disease, those with weakened immune systems, infants, and older adults./If you are concerned about symptoms, call a healthcare professional and tell them about recent travel or exposures. Do not go directly to the doctor�s office or hospital, where you may infect other people.//Diagnosis//There are laboratory tests available to detect human coronaviruses. For COVID-19, viral tests can detect current infection, and antibody tests can detect previous infection.//Prevention//Human coronaviruses can spread through:/coughing and sneezing/close personal contact (within about 6 feet), such as touching or shaking hands/touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes/fecal contamination (rarely)// There are steps you can take to help prevent infection:/limit contact with others and stay home as advised/wear a face mask consistently and correctly/practice social distancing (stay at least 6 feet apart from others)/wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds/avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth/cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze/clean and disinfect objects and surfaces/avoid close contact with people who are sick and stay home while you are sick/avoid nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor settings//New vaccines for COVID-19 have been authorized and recommended for emergency use in the US. CDC recommends that initial limited supplies of COVID-19 vaccines be allocated to healthcare professionals and long-term care facility residents.// Treatment//For all patients, supportive care is recommended:/take pain and fever medications/use a humidifier or take a hot shower/drink plenty of liquids/stay home and rest//The Food and Drug Administration has approved the antiviral drug remdesivir for treating certain patients who are hospitalized for COVID-19. Many clinical trials are underway in the United States and other countries to evaluate new drugs for treating patients with COVID-19.","PictureUrl":"Coronavirus.png","SpecializationId":1}

{"Name":"Diphtheria","Description":"Diphtheria is an acute bacterial disease that usually affects the tonsils, throat, nose, and/or skin. The disease is passed from person to person by droplet transmission, usually by breathing in bacteria after an infected person has coughed, sneezed, or even laughed. It can also be spread by handling used tissues or by drinking from a glass used by an infected person. Diphtheria can lead to breathing problems, heart failure, paralysis, and sometimes death.//Symptoms//Signs and symptoms may vary from mild to severe. They usually start two to five days after exposure. Symptoms often come on fairly gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In its early stages, diphtheria may be mistaken for a severe sore throat. Other symptoms include a low-grade fever and enlarged lymph nodes (swollen glands) located in the neck. Diphtheria can cause skin lesions that may be painful, red, and swollen. People carrying diphtheria germs are contagious for up to four weeks without antibiotics, even if they themselves do not develop symptoms.//Prevention//There is a vaccine to prevent diphtheria. Most people receive their first dose as children in the form of a combined vaccine called DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis). Health officials now recommend that adults and adolescents receive a Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis) booster vaccine to protect against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). This recommendation is instead of the previously recommended Td (tetanus-diphtheria) booster.//Facts about Diphtheria//Diphtheria is transmitted to others through close contact with discharges from an infected person�s nose, throat, eyes, and/or skin lesions./Diphtheria can lead to breathing problems, heart failure, paralysis, and sometimes death./Nearly one out of every 10 people who get diphtheria will die from it./Most cases of diphtheria occur among unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated people./Recovery from diphtheria is not always followed by lasting immunity, so even those persons who have survived the disease need to be immunized./Although no longer a very common disease in the US, diphtheria remains a large problem in other countries and can pose a serious threat to people in the US who may not be fully immunized and who travel to other countries, or have contact with people coming to the US from other parts of the world.","PictureUrl":"Diphtheria-v1.jpg","SpecializationId":4}

{"Name":"Ebola","Description":"Ebola is a rare and deadly disease caused by infection with a virus of the family�Filoviridae, genus�Ebolavirus. Ebola can cause disease in humans and other primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees)./Ebola was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, outbreaks have appeared sporadically in several African countries./The 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic was the largest in history, affecting multiple countries in West Africa. Although the risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States is very low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have taken precautions to prevent an outbreak from happening. Healthcare professionals caring for Ebola patients and those in close contact with Ebola patients are at highest risk of getting sick, as they may come into contact with the blood or body fluids of sick patients. The virus is spread to humans when there is direct contact (through broken skin; areas of the skin that have been opened by cuts, abrasions, dermatitis, chapped skin; or mucous membranes) with:/blood or body fluids/objects that have been contaminated with the virus (e.g., needles)/infected animals//Symptoms//It can take anywhere from two to 21 days after infection for symptoms to appear, but the average length of time is 8-10 days. Symptoms include fever (greater than 101.5�F), severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising.","PictureUrl":"Ebola.jpg","SpecializationId":5}

{"Name":"Flu(Influenza)","Description":"Influenza (flu) is a contagious viral infection that can cause mild to severe symptoms and life-threatening complications, including death, even in healthy children and adults.Influenza viruses spread mainly from one individual to another through coughing or sneezing. Less often, they can also spread through touching a contaminated surface and then touching the mouth, eyes, or nose. Individuals can pass flu on to others even before their own symptoms start and for a week or more after symptoms begin.//Burden//While the numbers vary, in the US, millions of individuals get sick, hundreds of thousands are hospitalized, and tens of thousands die from flu and related complications each year. Flu also affects employers and businesses and costs an estimated $11.2 billion in direct and indirect costs in the US annually. During the 2019-2020 flu season, flu vaccination prevented approximately 7.5 million flu illnesses, 105,000 hospitalizations, and 6,300 deaths.//Symptoms//Fever/Aches (muscle, body, and headaches)/Chills/Tiredness (fatigue)/Sudden onset/Cough, runny or stuffy nose, and/or sore throat/Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults)// Prevention//The best way to prevent flu is to receive an influenza vaccination every year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone age 6 months and older get vaccinated annually. Flu vaccination is especially important this year to help protect individuals and prevent additional strain on an already overburdened US healthcare system. The best time to get vaccinated is in the early fall, before influenza viruses begin spreading in your community. However, vaccination throughout the flu season is still beneficial.Flu vaccines are updated annually to protect against the influenza viruses research indicates are most likely to circulate during the upcoming season. Flu vaccines can vary in how well they work, but even in cases when flu vaccination does not prevent infection completely, it can reduce the severity and duration of disease and prevent serious complications. For more than 50 years, hundreds of millions of individuals in the US have safely received seasonal flu vaccines.//Treatment//Annual flu vaccination is the best way to prevent flu. Antiviral drugs are not a substitute for annual flu vaccination; however, prescription antiviral medications serve as an additional line of defense. CDC recommends that all individuals who are hospitalized, severely ill, or at high risk for developing serious flu-related complications should be treated with antiviral drugs immediately if flu is suspected./Treatment of flu with antiviral drugs can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the duration of illness by one to two days, and prevent serious complications, like pneumonia. Antivirals work best when taken within 48 hours of getting sick, but may still be beneficial when given later in the course of illness./","PictureUrl":"Flu.jpg","SpecializationId":2},
{"Name":"Hib Disease","Description":"Hib disease is a serious illness caused by the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae type b. Babies and children younger than 5 years old are most at risk for Hib disease, but it can also affect adults with certain medical conditions.Hib bacteria can cause mild illness, such as ear infections or bronchitis, or they can cause severe illness, such as infections of the bloodstream. Hib disease can cause lifelong disability and be deadly.//Prevention//The Hib vaccine prevents Hib disease. Depending on the brand of the Hib vaccine, three or four doses are recommended. Infants will usually get their first dose of Hib vaccine at age 2 months, and will usually complete the series by the time they are 12- to 15-months old./According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), before Hib vaccine, Hib disease was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among children under age 5 years in the US.","PictureUrl":"Hib.png","SpecializationId":2},
{"Name":"HIV/AIDS","Description":"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging the immune system, HIV interferes with the body�s ability to fight the organisms that cause disease.HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breast-feeding. Without medication, HIV gradually weakens the immune system to the point that an infected individual may develop AIDS.//Burden//Approximately 1.1 million people in the US are living with HIV today. About 15 percent of them (1 in 7) are unaware they are infected. An estimated 38,000 people became newly infected with HIV in the US each year.//Symptoms//HIV infection happens in three stages. Without treatment, it gets worse over time and eventually overpowers the immune system. Symptoms depend on the stage (Acute, Clinical Latency, AIDS).//Prevention//Various strategies are available to prevent HIV including correctly using condoms during sex, limiting the number of sexual partners, never sharing needles, and abstinence (not having sex). Individuals who are at risk for HIV can protect themselves through pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)�taking daily antiretroviral medicines (ART) before being exposed to the HIV virus. Individuals who think they may have been exposed to HIV should talk to a healthcare professional about post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)�taking ART after being exposed to prevent becoming infected./If you have HIV, there are actions you can take to avoid transmitting it to others. The most important is taking HIV medicine (ART) as prescribed. If you take HIV medicine as prescribed and stay virally suppressed, you can stay healthy and have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to an HIV-negative sex partner.//Treatment//There is currently no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are medications that can slow the progression of the disease. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations.","PictureUrl":"HIV-virus.jpg","SpecializationId":5},
{"Name":"HPV(Human Papillomavirus)","Description":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection that can cause certain cancers and genital warts. About 80 percent of sexually active men and women are infected with HPV at some point in their lives and most new infections are in individuals in their teens and early 20s. Most individuals will have no symptoms and may never know they have the virus, but while infected, can spread the virus.Although most infections go away on their own in a few years, HPV infections that do not go away can lead to cancer. HPV causes almost all cervical cancer in the US and can also cause cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, mouth, and throat./Individuals can pass the virus on even if they have no symptoms and even if years have passed since they were first infected.//Burden//In the US, about 79 million individuals are currently infected with HPV/It is estimated that more than 14 million new HPV infections occur in the US each year/Before HPV vaccines were introduced, roughly 340,000 to 360,000 women and men were affected by genital warts caused by HPV every year/Every year, more than 12,000 women living in the US will be diagnosed and more than 4,000 women die from cervical cancer. Approximately 19,000 women and 12,000 men are affected annually by cancers caused by HPV.//Symptoms//Some individuals infected with HPV may not exhibit signs or symptoms./HPV can cause genital warts. Genital warts usually appear as a small bump or group of bumps in the genital area. They can be small or large, raised or flat, or shaped like a cauliflower. A healthcare professional can usually diagnose warts by examining the genital area./Other types of HPV can lead to cancer.//Prevention//The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 11- to 12-year-olds get two doses of HPV vaccine to protect against cancers caused by HPV. The second dose should be given 6-12 months after the first dose./Both males and females up to age 26 years who were not vaccinated at age 11 or 12 years should receive catch-up HPV vaccination. Three doses are recommended for those who initiate the vaccination series at or after age 15 years, and for those who have weakened immune systems (at 0, 1�2, and 6 months). HPV vaccine may be given beginning at age 9 years./Adults age 27-45 years should talk to a healthcare professional about whether HPV vaccination is right for them. Shared clinical decision-making is recommended because some individuals who are not adequately vaccinated might benefit from vaccination.//Treatment//There is no treatment for infection caused by the virus itself; however, there are treatments for some of the health problems that HPV can cause, such as genital warts and certain cancers. Consult with a healthcare professional on the best course of treatment.","PictureUrl":"HPV-v1.jpg","SpecializationId":1},
{"Name":"Measles","Description":"Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that can result in severe, sometimes permanent, complications including pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and even death./Measles is caused by a virus that lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person and spreads easily through breathing, coughing, and sneezing. When someone with measles coughs, sneezes, or talks, infected droplets spray into the air (where other people can inhale them) or land on a surface, where they remain active and contagious for several hours. If others breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90% of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected. Infected people can spread measles to others from four days before through four days after the rash appears.//Burden//Measles is highly contagiousMeasles can be serious:/About 1 in 5 people in the US who get measles will be hospitalized/1 out of every 1,000 people with measles will develop brain swelling, which could lead to brain damage/As many as 1 in 20 children with measles gets pneumonia/1 to 3 out of 1,000 people with measles will die, even with the best care/According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 1,200 individual cases of measles were confirmed in 2019 in 31 states�the largest number of cases since measles was eliminated in the US in 2000.//Symptoms//Symptoms include rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever. Children with measles often feel miserable and may miss school, with loss of appetite, diarrhea, and sensitivity to any light./The rash usually appears about 14 days after a person is exposed. The rash spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities.  Patients who have compromised immune systems do not always develop the rash.//Prevention//The measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is a safe and effective way to protect you and your family from measles./In the US, two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended for children. Infants normally get their first measles vaccine between 12 and 15 months followed by another shot between 4 and 6 years. However, CDC recommends that any baby as young as 6 months old who will be travelling internationally should get a vaccine before leaving the US, followed by two additional doses later./Adolescents who were not previously vaccinated should get two doses (with at least 28 days between doses); those who only received one dose previously should get the second dose./All adults born in 1957 or later who have not been vaccinated or have not had measles should be vaccinated. CDC states that if you are not sure about your vaccination status, it is safe to get another measles vaccine./The only people who should not get measles vaccine are those who are immunocompromised or pregnant. Talk to a healthcare professional to find out if you should receive a vaccination.//Treatment//There is no specific antiviral drug available to treat measles. The goal of medical care is to relieve symptoms and address complications such as bacterial infections. Severe measles cases among children, including those who are hospitalized, may be treated with vitamin A.","PictureUrl":"Measles.jpg","SpecializationId":2},
{"Name":"Meningococcal Disease","Description":"Meningococcal (muh-nin-jo-cok-ul) disease is a serious bacterial illness that can lead to severe swelling of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or infection of the bloodstream (meningococcal septicemia or meningococcemia). Even with treatment, approximately one out of every 10 people who get meningococcal disease will die, and of those who survive, up to 20 percent will suffer serious and permanent complications including brain damage, kidney damage, hearing loss, and amputation of arms, legs, fingers, or toes./Anyone can get meningococcal disease but certain people are at increased risk, including:/Infants younger than one year old/Adolescents and young adults age 16 through 23 years old/People with certain medical conditions that affect the immune system/Microbiologists who routinely work with isolates of N. meningitidis, the bacteria that cause meningococcal disease/People at risk because of an outbreak in their community/According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), meningococcal bacteria spread through the exchange of respiratory and throat secretions like saliva or spit (e.g., by coughing, living in close quarters, kissing). Meningococcal disease can be treated with antibiotics, but quick medical attention is extremely important.//Prevention//Keeping up to date with recommended vaccines is the best way to protect against meningococcal disease. Two meningococcal vaccines (MenACWY and MenB) provide protection against the five serogroups that cause most meningococcal disease in the US (serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y). CDC recommends meningococcal vaccines for preteens, teens, and people with certain medical conditions, travel plans, or jobs. The recommendations for the use of these vaccines differ:/Meningococcal ACWY vaccine is recommended for all adolescents at age 11-12 years with a booster dose at age 16 years./Meningococcal ACWY vaccine is recommended for children age 2 months through 10 years who have an increased risk of infection due to certain medical conditions, travel, or an outbreak./Teens and young adults (16 through 23 year olds) may also get a MenB vaccine, preferably at 16 through 18 years old. CDC does not routinely recommend this vaccine and asks that parents and healthcare professionals discuss the risk of disease and weigh the risks and benefits of vaccination before deciding. People need multiple doses of a MenB vaccine for best protection and must get the same brand for all doses./Meningococcal B vaccines are recommended for people age 10 years or older who are at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease, including people at risk because of an outbreak./Talk to your healthcare professional to make sure that your family is protected against this deadly disease.","PictureUrl":"Neisseria-meningitidis-e1572978893110.jpg","SpecializationId":4},
{"Name":"Mumps","Description":"Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. There is no cure for mumps, and it can cause serious health problems. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to help protect against mumps.//Burden//Before the vaccine, about 186,000 cases of mumps were reported each year in the US/Compared to the pre-vaccine era, the number of mumps cases in the US dropped by more than 99 percent/Outbreaks of mumps still occur in the US, usually among people who live in close quarters or have prolonged, close contact with an individual who has mumps. Mumps spreads easily through coughing or sneezing, or through close contact, such as sharing cups or water bottles, kissing, or playing sports with someone who has been infected.//Symptoms//Mumps typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swelling of the salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides, which causes puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw./Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12�25 days after infection. Some people who get mumps have very mild symptoms (like a cold), or no symptoms at all and may not know they have the disease./Most people with mumps recover completely within two weeks. However, in rare cases, mumps can cause serious complications, including:/swollen testicles, which may lead to a decrease in testicular size/swollen ovaries or breast tissue/inflammation in the pancreas (pancreatitis)/inflammation of the brain (encephalitis)/inflammation of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)/deafness/Neither inflammation of the testicles nor inflammation of the ovaries caused by mumps has been shown to lead to infertility.//Prevention//The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to protect against mumps. Among those who are vaccinated, some may still get mumps if they are exposed to the virus but the risk of getting the disease in a vaccinated person is much lower compared to an unvaccinated person.//Treatment//here are currently no medications available to treat mumps. Getting plenty of rest, drinking enough fluids, applying a warm or cool compress to swollen glands, eating softer foods that do not require as much chewing, and over-the-counter painkillers can help.","PictureUrl":"Mumps.jpg","SpecializationId":1},
{"Name":"Norovirus","Description":"Noroviruses are a group of related viruses that are highly contagious. You can get norovirus from an infected person, contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces. Infection with these viruses affects the stomach and intestines and causes an illness called gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intestines).//Burden//Commonly referred to as �food poisoning� or a �stomach bug,� noroviruses are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the US. Each year in the US, norovirus causes between 19-21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis; 1.7�1.9 million outpatient visits and 400,000 emergency department visits, primarily in young children; and about 56,000�71,000 hospitalizations and 570-800 deaths, mostly among young children and older adults./About 1 in every 15 individuals in the US will get norovirus illness annually. By five years of age, one out of every 14 children will visit an emergency room and one out of 278 children will be hospitalized due to norovirus./Norovirus outbreaks have been reported in many settings, including healthcare facilities, restaurants and catered events, schools, and childcare centers. Cruise ships account for a small percentage (1%) of reported norovirus outbreaks overall.//Symptoms//Anyone can be infected with noroviruses and get sick. You can get norovirus illness more than once during your lifetime. The illness often begins suddenly. You may feel very sick, with stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.//Prevention//Washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water is the best way to protect yourself and others from norovirus. It is especially important to wash your hands after using the bathroom or changing diapers; before eating, preparing, or handling food; and before giving yourself or someone else medicine. Avoid preparing food or caring for others when you are sick. Always carefully wash fruits and vegetables before preparing and eating them. Cook oysters and other shellfish before eating them./Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used in addition to, but are not a substitute for, hand washing with soap and water, which is more effective at removing norovirus particles./After someone vomits or has diarrhea, it is important to clean and disinfect. Wear rubber or disposable gloves and wipe the entire area with paper towels. Then disinfect the area using a bleach-based household cleaner as directed on the product label. Be sure to clean soiled laundry, take out the trash, and wash your hands./No vaccines are currently available to prevent norovirus, although research is underway.//Treatment //If you have norovirus illness, drink plenty of liquids to prevent dehydration which can lead to serious problems. If you think you or someone you are caring for is severely dehydrated, call a healthcare professional./There are no specific medicines to treat people with norovirus. Antibiotics do not help because they fight bacteria, not viruses.","PictureUrl":"Norovirus.jpg","SpecializationId":2},
{"Name":"Penumococcal Disease","Description":"Pneumococcal disease is caused by common bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae) that can attack different parts of the body. When these bacteria invade the lungs, they can cause pneumonia; when they invade the bloodstream, they can cause sepsis; and when they invade the covering of the brain, they can cause meningitis. These invasive infections are serious, often require treatment in the hospital, and can lead to death. The bacteria can also cause milder common conditions like middle-ear infection (otitis media) and sinusitis.//Burden//Pneumococcal disease is a leading cause of serious illness throughout the world. About 1.3 million persons visit emergency departments in the US each year with pneumonia, which is often caused by pneumococcal infections, and nearly 50,000 people will die from pneumonia. In the US, it is estimated that more than 150,000 hospitalizations from pneumococcal pneumonia occur each year, and about 5-7% of those who are hospitalized from it will die. The death rate is even higher in those age 65 years and older. Fewer people will get pneumococcal meningitis or bloodstream infection, but the mortality rate for these infections is higher, even with proper treatment.//Symptoms//The symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia (which are similar to pneumonia caused by other organisms) include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The symptoms of pneumococcal meningitis include stiff neck, fever, mental confusion and disorientation, and coma. The symptoms of pneumococcal bloodstream infection may be similar to some of the symptoms of pneumonia and meningitis, along with chills, a drop in blood pressure, and organ dysfunction severe enough to require ICU care.//Prevention//Vaccines are recommended for all children and for certain adults�those age 65 years and older, and adults age 19 to 64 years with certain risk conditions. Still, many at-risk adults have not been vaccinated against pneumococcal disease./In the US, there are two types of pneumococcal vaccines currently available and recommended for different groups of people. Talk to a healthcare professional about pneumococcal vaccination.//Treatment//Antibiotics may be used to treat pneumococcal disease. However, antibiotic resistance does occur with pneumococcal bacteria. Treatment may start with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which works against a wide range of bacteria. After testing, once the sensitivity of the bacteria is known, a more targeted antibiotic may be selected.","PictureUrl":"Pneumococcal-v1-1.jpg","SpecializationId":2},
{"Name":"Polio","Description":"Polio is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by a virus that invades the nervous system. Poliovirus spreads through contact with the stool (feces) of an infected person or droplets from a sneeze or cough.//Symptoms//Most individuals infected with the virus will not experience any symptoms at all; some individuals will experience minor symptoms such as fever, fatigue, nausea, headache, flu-like symptoms, stiffness in the neck and back, and pain in the limbs which often resolves completely. In some people, the polio virus can result in paralysis (usually the legs), which can lead to permanent disability and death, in most cases by paralyzing the muscles that help them breathe.//Prevention//Since widespread use of the vaccine in the US, which began in the 1950s, polio has been eliminated in the US. However, the virus continues to circulate in different parts of the world, so it�s important to make sure that those individuals who did not get the vaccine as a young child get it now./Anyone who did not receive a complete vaccine series (three doses at 2, 4, and 6-18 months, one dose at 4-6 years) as a child should complete the series as soon as possible.","PictureUrl":"Polio.jpg","SpecializationId":3},
{"Name":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus","Description":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a respiratory virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages. Healthy people usually experience mild, cold-like symptoms and recover in 1-2 weeks. But RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults./RSV can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes and droplets get in the eyes, nose, or mouth of a healthy person. Additionally, touching a contaminated surface that has the virus on it, like a doorknob, and then touching your face can expose you to the virus. RSV can also spread through direct contact with the virus, like kissing the face of a child with RSV./RSV can survive for many hours on hard surfaces such as tables and crib rails. It typically lives on soft surfaces such as tissues and hands for shorter amounts of time. Children are often exposed to RSV outside the home, such as in school or daycare centers. They can then transmit the virus to other members of the family.//Burden//RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia in children <1 year of age in the US. Almost all children will have had an RSV infection by their 2nd birthday. On average each year in the US, RSV leads to approximately 2.1 million outpatient visits and 58,000 hospitalizations among children younger than age 5 years./RSV is also increasingly recognized as a significant cause of respiratory illness in older adults and is estimated to cause 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths in adults 65 and older in the US every year./People of all ages can get RSV infection but those at highest risk for severe disease include:/premature infants/young children with congenital heart or chronic lung disease/young children with weakened immune systems due to a medical condition or medical treatment/adults with compromised immune systems/older adults, especially those with underlying heart or lung disease.//Symptoms//Symptoms of RSV infection usually include: runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever, and wheezing. The symptoms usually appear in stages and not all at once. In very young infants, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and breathing difficulties. People infected with RSV usually show symptoms within 4 to 6 days after getting infected./People infected with RSV are usually contagious for 3 to 8 days. However, some infants, and people with weakened immune systems, can continue to spread the virus even after they stop showing symptoms, for as long as 4 weeks.//Prevention//To help prevent the spread of RSV, those with symptoms should:/Cover coughs and sneezes/Wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds/Avoid touching their face with unwashed hands/Avoid close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others/In addition, cleaning contaminated surfaces (such as doorknobs) may help stop the spread of RSV./Researchers are working to develop RSV vaccines, but none are available yet.//Treatment//A drug called palivizumab (pah-lih-VIH-zu-mahb) is available to prevent severe RSV illness in certain infants and children who are at high risk for severe disease (infants born prematurely or with congenital heart disease or chronic lung disease.)

Each year in the United States, rotavirus is responsible for an estimated:/250,000 emergency room visits/410,000 visits to doctors� offices/20-60 deaths/Up to 70,000 hospitalizations//Symptoms//Rotavirus symptoms include fever, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. Although symptoms vary, children may experience fever, upset stomach and vomiting, along with frequent watery diarrhea, sometimes multiple times a day. Symptoms typically last three to nine days.","PictureUrl":"Rotavirus.jpg","SpecializationId":7},
{"Name":"Rubella(German Measles)","Description":"Rubella, sometimes called �German measles,� is a disease caused by a virus. The infection is usually mild with fever and rash, but if a pregnant woman gets infected, the virus can cause serious birth defects. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to help protect against rubella. Women should make sure they are protected from rubella before getting pregnant.//Burden//During the last major rubella epidemic in the US from 1964-1965:/12.5 million people got rubella/11,000 pregnant women lost their babies/2,100 newborns died/20,000 babies were born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)/Since the rubella vaccine became available in the US, the number of people infected with rubella dropped dramatically. Currently, less than 10 people in the US contract rubella each year./Although rubella was declared eliminated from the US in 2004, cases can occur when unvaccinated individuals are exposed to infected individuals, mostly through international travel./Anyone who is not vaccinated against rubella is at risk of getting the disease. It is important that children and women of childbearing age are vaccinated against rubella.//Symptoms//Children/In children, rubella usually causes a low-grade fever (less than 101 degrees) and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. These symptoms may last two or three days. Older children with rubella usually first suffer from low-grade fever, swollen glands in the neck or behind the ears, and upper respiratory infection, before they develop a rash. Rubella is usually mild in children./Adults/Complications of rubella are rare, but they occur more often in adults. Adults (especially young women) may have aching joints, headache, and pink eye before the rash appears. Up to 70 percent of women who get rubella may experience arthritis; this is rare in children and men. In rare cases, rubella can cause serious problems, including brain infections and bleeding problems./About 25-50 percent of people who get rubella do not have symptoms./Pregnant Women/Rubella is very dangerous for pregnant women and their developing babies. If a pregnant woman is infected with rubella, she can pass the virus to her baby, which can lead to a miscarriage or an infant born with the congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). CRS can cause severe birth defects such as heart problems, loss of hearing and eyesight, intellectual disability, and liver or spleen damage./Prevention/Rubella spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes and touches objects or surfaces with unwashed hands. The disease is most contagious when the infected person has a rash. But it can spread up to seven days before the rash appears and up to seven days after. People without symptoms can still spread rubella./The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine can help prevent rubella. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended. The first dose of MMR vaccine is usually given at age 12-15 months; the second dose is given at age 4-6 years./Because MMR vaccine is an attenuated (weakened) live virus vaccine, pregnant women should not get MMR vaccine. Women who are planning to become pregnant should check with their healthcare professional to make sure they are vaccinated before they get pregnant.//Treatment//There are currently no medications available to treat rubella. Mild symptoms can be managed with bed rest and medicines for fever.","PictureUrl":"Rubella-2.jpg","SpecializationId":6},
{"Name":"Shingles(Herpes Zoster)","Description":"Shingles is a viral infection that can cause a painful rash. Shingles is caused by the herpes zoster virus�the same virus that causes chickenpox. The virus stays inactive in the body for life and can reactivate years, or even decades later, causing shingles. About 98% of US adults have had chickenpox and are at risk for shingles./The chance of getting shingles increases with age, which is why shingles vaccination is recommended for all healthy adults age 50 years and older. Children can get shingles, but it is not common.//Burden//Almost 1 out of 3 people in the US will develop shingles during their lifetime./Half of the population who lives to age 85 will experience shingles./Up to 4% of people who get shingles are hospitalized for complications. Adults age 65 and over and people with weakened or suppressed immune system are more likely to be hospitalized./Shingles causes fewer than 100 deaths annually in the US. Almost all shingles deaths are in older adults or people with compromised immune systems.//Symptoms//Shingles causes a painful rash that can be severe. The shingles rash usually develops on one side of the face or body. You may not be able to see the first signs of the rash, but you might feel pain, itching, or tingling in the areas where the rash will develop./The virus can cause nerve pain that can last for months or even years. The older you are, the greater your risk of long-term nerve pain. Long-term nerve pain has been described as burning, stabbing, throbbing, or shooting./Shingles can also develop in the eyes and cause vision loss./Other symptoms include fever, headache, chills, upset stomach, muscle weakness, skin infection, scarring, and decrease or loss of vision or hearing./Even after the rash is gone, some may experience a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN can cause intense pain where the rash was, and the pain can be very hard to treat, especially in older adults.//Prevention//There is a safe, effective vaccine available to help prevent shingles. Getting vaccinated is the best way to reduce your chance of developing shingles or reduce your chances of long-lasting pain if you do get shingles./Shingles vaccination is recommended for all healthy adults age 50 years and older./Even if you have already had shingles, the disease can come back. Those who have had shingles can still receive shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no specific length of time you must wait after having shingles before receiving shingles vaccine, but generally, you should make sure the shingles rash has disappeared before getting vaccinated. The decision on when to get vaccinated should be discussed with a healthcare professional.//Treatment//Antiviral drugs are available to treat shingles and shorten the duration and severity of the illness. These medicines are most effective if you start taking them as soon as possible after the rash appears. If you think you have shingles, contact a healthcare professional as soon as possible to discuss treatment./Pain medicine, either over-the-counter or prescription, may help relieve the pain caused by shingles. Wet compresses, calamine lotion, and oatmeal baths (a lukewarm bath mixed with ground up oatmeal) may help relieve itching./Getting vaccinated is the best way to reduce your chance of getting shingles or reduce your chances of long-lasting pain if you do get shingles.","PictureUrl":"Chickenpox-Shingles-Varicella-Zoster.jpg","SpecializationId":8},
{"Name":"Tetanus(Lockjaw)","Description":"Tetanus, commonly called lockjaw, is a bacterial disease that affects the nervous system. It is contracted through cuts or wounds that become contaminated with tetanus bacteria. The bacteria can get in through deep puncture wounds or cuts like those made by nails or knives, but even a scratch can provide an entryway. Tetanus bacteria are present worldwide and are commonly found in soil and most surfaces. The infection causes severe muscle spasms, leading to �locking� of the jaw, making it hard to open the mouth or swallow. In severe cases, tetanus infections can lead to death by suffocation/.Tetanus is a vaccine-preventable disease that is not transmitted from person to person.//Symptoms//Common initial symptoms of tetanus are a headache and muscular stiffness in the jaw (lockjaw) followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty swallowing, hardening of abdominal muscles, spasms, sweating, and fever. Symptoms usually begin around eight days following infection, but onset may range from three days to three weeks.//Prevention//Vaccination is the best way to prevent tetanus. Due to widespread immunization, tetanus is a rare disease in the US. Most people receive their first dose as children in the form of a combined vaccine called DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis). Health officials now recommend that adults and adolescents receive a Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis) or Td (tetanus-diphtheria) booster vaccine every 10 years./Fact: Tetanus can be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine./Fact: People with tetanus may have to spend several weeks in the hospital under intensive care./Fact: Tetanus is not transmitted from one person to another./Fact: Recovery from tetanus illness may not result in lifelong immunity. Another infection could occur unless immunization is provided soon after the person�s condition has stabilized.","PictureUrl":"Tetanus.jpg","SpecializationId":4},
{"Name":"Whooping Cough(Pertussis)","Description":"Whooping cough (also called pertussis) is a highly contagious and serious infection that spreads easily from person to person through coughing, sneezing, and breathing The infection causes coughing spells that are so severe that it can be hard to breathe, eat, or sleep. Whooping cough can even lead to cracked ribs, pneumonia, or hospitalization./Many babies who get whooping cough are infected by older siblings, parents, or caregivers who might not even know they have the disease./Booster vaccines are recommended, as protection from childhood vaccination wears off, putting adolescents and adults at risk for the infection.//Burden//According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), worldwide, there are an estimated 16 million cases of whooping cough and about 195,000 deaths per year. Since the 1980s, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases in the US./Before pertussis vaccines became widely available in the 1940s, as many as 200,000 children got sick with whooping cough each year in the US and about 9,000 died as a result of the infection. Currently, 10,000 to 40,000 cases are reported in the US each year, occasionally leading to death.//Symptoms//The classic symptom is a �whoop,� the sound of someone gasping for breath during a bad coughing spell. But you can have the infection without the �whoop.� Whooping cough can be spread before symptoms appear. It can be tough to diagnose because early symptoms may appear like the common cold or bronchitis./Whooping cough can be passed to vulnerable infants, those who have not yet received any or all of their vaccines. For babies, complications can be severe, even deadly.//Prevention//Babies and children should get 5 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP) for maximum protection�one dose at 2, 4, and 6 months, one at 15-18 months, and another at 4-6 years. A booster dose of tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) is recommended for preteens at 11 or 12 years of age./Teens or adults who did not get vaccinated against Tdap as a preteen should get one dose./Pregnant women should get Tdap during the third trimester of each pregnancy to help protect mother and baby./It is also important that caretakers and those who are around infants are up to date with whooping cough vaccination.//Treatment//There are several antibiotics available to treat whooping cough, and early treatment is very important. Treatment can make the infection less serious if started early, before coughing fits begin. Antibiotics also may shorten the amount of time someone is contagious, which can help prevent spreading the disease to other people. Whooping cough can sometimes be very serious, requiring treatment in the hospital./Fact: This serious infectious disease is on the rise in the US, across all age groups./Fact: Protection against whooping cough from early childhood vaccines wears off. Adolescents and adults are at risk for infection./Fact: Whooping cough causes coughing spells that can affect breathing, eating, and sleeping. The infection can even lead to cracked ribs and hospitalization./Fact: Adults and adolescents can spread whooping cough to young infants who have not had all their vaccines. Babies are at greatest risk for serious complications, even death.","PictureUrl":"Pertussis-v1.png","SpecializationId":3},
{"Name":"Zika","Description":"Zika virus disease is caused by a virus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. Zika can be transmitted by pregnant women to developing babies, and infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other serious birth defects. Pregnant women who develop symptoms of Zika virus infection should be closely monitored by a healthcare professional./The most common form of Zika transmission is through mosquito bites, but the virus has been isolated in semen, and cases of sexual transmission have been observed. Currently the available evidence is being analyzed to better understand the public health impact of sexual transmission of Zika.//Burden//The virus was isolated for the first time in 1947 in the Zika forest in Uganda. Since then, it has remained mainly in Africa, with small and sporadic outbreaks in Asia. In 2007, a major epidemic was reported on the island of Yap (Micronesia), where nearly 75 percent of the population was infected. Large outbreaks occurred in 2015 and 2016 in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, and there was limited local transmission in Florida and Texas./Countries begin reporting when they detect the circulation of the virus. Maintaining a case count is difficult because symptoms of the disease tend to be mild and not everyone affected is seen by a healthcare professional.//Symptoms//Symptoms may include mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise, or headache. One out of four people may develop symptoms, but in those who are affected, the disease is usually mild with symptoms that can last between two and seven days./Symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito./Neurological and autoimmune complications are infrequent, but have been described in outbreaks in Polynesia, Brazil, and other countries.//Prevention//The best way to prevent Zika is to reduce mosquito populations and avoid bites:/Prevent standing water in outdoor containers and drains (flower pots and containers that collect water) so that they do not become mosquito breeding sites/Cover domestic water tanks so that mosquitoes cannot get in/Keep garbage in closed plastic bags and closed containers/Use screens and mosquito nets in windows and doors to reduce contact between mosquitoes and people/Cover exposed skin with long-sleeved shirts, pants, and hats/Use repellents recommended by health authorities, applying them as indicated/ Pregnant women should avoid travel to areas of ongoing Zika virus outbreaks; pregnant women whose sexual partners live in or travel to areas with Zika virus outbreaks should ensure safe sexual practices or abstain from sex for the duration of their pregnancy. Travelers to areas with Zika virus outbreaks should be provided with up to date advice on potential risks and appropriate measures to reduce the possibility of exposure to mosquito bites and, upon return, should take appropriate measures, including safe sex, to reduce the risk of transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains updated information on countries with a potential risk of Zika./All patients (male and female) with Zika virus infection and their sexual partners should receive information about the potential risks of sexual transmission of Zika virus, contraceptive measures and safe sex practices, including the use of condoms.//Treatment//Treatment consists of relieving pain, fever, and other symptoms. It�s important to rest and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. There is no vaccine or specific medicine currently available","PictureUrl":"Zika.png","SpecializationId":7}
